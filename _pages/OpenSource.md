The UASAL team is an active contributor to the Physical Optics Propagation in Python library, [POPPY](https://github.com/spacetelescope/poppy). A BSD licensed open source project, POPPY provides user-friendly, high-performance set of diffraction simulation tools in both the Fresnel and Fraunhofer regimes, broadly applicably but particularly well suited to astronomical telescopes and high-contrast imaging.

We have also begun contributing to the [CubeSat Climate CoBuild](https://c3.pubpub.org/) open source outreach hardware project.
